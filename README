Overview
========

This module replaces the openbsd package provider supplied with Puppet. By
interfacing directly with the OpenBSD package library, this module's package
provider allows for greater specificity when installing and removing packages.

Configuration
=============

Like the default openbsd package provider, this provider uses the :source
parameter to set the PKG_PATH when interacting with the OpenBSD package tools
(pkg_add, pkg_delete). Unlike the default provider, however, this provider
uses package specifications (see packages-specs(7) on OpenBSD), not package
stems, to select packages for installation or removal. This allows you to choose
the flavor, version or even version range you wish to install or remove.

For example:

    package { "python->=2.6,<2.7": alias => "python2.6" }

In this example, any version of Python that's greater than 2.6 and less than 2.7
will be installed. You can also specify which package flavor to install or
remove:

	package { "vim-*-no_x11": ensure => present }

Here, any version of Vim that was built for systems without X11 will be
installed. Packages with name parameters that are not valid OpenBSD package
specifications will result in no match; the following, for example, is
incorrect:

	package { "vim": ensure => present }

Instead, to select any set of flavors or versions, use a double dash:

    package { "vim--": ensure => present }
